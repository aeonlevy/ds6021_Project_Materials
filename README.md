# SNAP Benefits Analysis — Final Project (DS 6021)

This project analyzes how socioeconomic and demographic factors relate to SNAP (food stamp) benefits across U.S. states. We combine four datasets:

- **USDA SNAP Benefits (2024–2025)** — monthly benefits & caseloads  
- **ACS Median Household Income (2024)**  
- **ACS Race Composition (B02001, 2024)**  
- **Cost of Living Index (2024)**  

## Project Tasks
1. Data cleaning and feature engineering  
2. Visual exploration of income, COLI, demographics, and SNAP benefits  
3. Predictive modeling (Linear Regression, KNN, MLP)  
4. Unsupervised learning (PCA + K-Means Clustering)  
5. Interpretation and conclusions  

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook `benefits_per_state_data.ipynb`  
2. Run all cells in order  
3. All datasets must be placed in the same directory as the notebook  
4. Requires Python 3.11+ with pandas, numpy, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib
